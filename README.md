# Ice Desk
 September build of Ice Desk - open sourced and free to use.

##Tired of waiting for keys?
Great news! Ice Desk is now available to the public on Github!

##Are we allowed to use this in any projects?
Yes, you can! No need to worry! The official Ice Desk team welcomes you to **build off any files listed inside the repository after you clone.**

##Why do this?
Since Ice Desk was originally meant to be a community-based server, we decided to make it *truly* community based on behalf of the original contributers to the source.

##Is this version safe?
Feel free to scan yourself and give us feedback on your findings!

##Credit goes to Mr. Batty and Alexalexer for this build of the source.
